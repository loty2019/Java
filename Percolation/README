The project's goal is to create a program that can estimate the percolation threshold of a given system. 
Percolation is a concept used to model the behavior of composite systems composed of randomly distributed insulating
and metallic materials or porous landscapes with water on the surface (or oil below). It aims to answer the question of
what fraction of the system needs to be metallic (or open) to allow the composite system to act as an electrical conductor 
(or allow the liquid to flow through).

The model used for this project is a percolation system represented as an n x n grid of sites. Each site in the grid can
be either open or blocked. A full site is defined as an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row of 
the grid via a chain of neighboring open sites (left, right, up, down). The system is said to percolate if there exists at
least one full site in the bottom row. In other words, a system percolates if all open sites connected to the top row can 
reach some open site on the bottom row.

The project's objective is to develop a program that can determine the critical threshold at which percolation occurs in 
such systems. This threshold represents the minimum fraction of open sites necessary for the system to exhibit the 
percolation behavior, either in the context of electrical conductivity for insulating/metallic materials or fluid flow for
porous substances.
